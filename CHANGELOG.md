# Unreleased

Added:

- Command bar (opened by pressing (`Ctrl` + `K` (macOS: `CMD` + `K`)))
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts for common actions, such as changing buffer focus, maximize / restoring buffer size, 
  cycling channels in the buffer and more! A new `keys` section has been added to the config file, reference the 
  [wiki](https://github.com/squidowl/halloy/wiki/Keyboard-shortcuts) for more details.
- Single clicking on a user will insert nickname to input
- Configuration option `notification` to control and enable notifications

# 2023.3 (2023-07-27)

**Message history and dashboard state will be reset due to a breaking change. We've switched to a more flexible storage format 
to ensure future breakages won't occur.**

Added:

- Away-notify extension added for supported servers
- SASL support for PLAIN & EXTERNAL. The following per-server config keys have been added:
  - PLAIN - `sasl.plain.username` & `sasl.plain.password`
  - EXTERNAL - `sasl.external.cert` is a path to the PEM encoded X509 cert
- Configuration option `buffer.hidden_server_messages` to hide server messages from the provided array of sources: ["join", "part", "quit"]
- Configuration option `buffer.input_visibility` to control input field visibility: always shown or following the focused buffer.
- Portable mode - if a config file exists in the same directory as the executable, all Halloy data will be saved to that directory
- Upon joining a channel, display the channel mode in the buffer
- When querying an away user, you will see an away message
- Autocomplete on joined channels

Changed:

- Away users will be appear slightly transparent in nicklist
- Configuration option `new_buffer` has been renamed to `buffer`. `new_buffer` key will still work for backwards compatibility.
- Migrated to our own internal IRC backend. This should allow for quicker development against extensions and bug fixes.

Fixed:

- Changes done in the config file are now properly applied to the old buffers
- Text and colors on light themes will no longer appear washed out
- All WHOIS responses are now properly routed to the buffer where the request was made (text input or via context menu)
- Accessing text input history will only populate the current buffer, not all of them
- Text from input box can be copied to clipboard
- Prevent text input cursor from blinking when window loses focus

# 2023.2 (2023-07-07)

Added:

- Nickname completions in text input with <kbd>Tab</kbd>
- Previously sent messages can be accessed per buffer in the text input with <kbd>â†‘</kbd> / <kbd>â†“</kbd> arrows
- New configuration option `dashboard.sidebar_default_action` to control pane behaviour when selecting buffers
- Messages from other users containing your nickname are now highlighted
- Themes directory where users can add their own theme files
- Broadcast nickname changes to relevant channels and queries.
- Broadcast quit messages to relevant channels and queries.
- Better error descriptions on connection failures
- Support RAW command
- Drag & drop buffers to the edges for better customization of the grid
- Whois messages are printed in the currently focused buffer

Changed:

- Default channel in `config.yaml` has been changed to `#halloy` (from `##rust`)
- `palette` field has been deprecated and replaced by `theme` in `config.yaml`
- Sorting channel nicknames
- Title headers has been changed to also display user count for channels
- Copy change: "Leave" has been changed to "Close query" for queries

Fixed:
